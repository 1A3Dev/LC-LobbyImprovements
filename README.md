### Information

This mod adds various features relating to lobbies:

- Invite Only Lobbies
  - There are ways that people can join the regular friend-only lobbies if you don't have your steam p from the steam profile.
  - This is a clone of my deprecated mod [LobbyInviteOnly](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Dev1A3/LobbyInviteOnly)
- LAN Improvements
  - Customisable Port
  - Lobby List
    - You can directly connect to an IP via the text input above the lobby list (the port is optional and can be specified after a colon for example: 127.0.0.1:7777)
    - This uses UDP to discover other lobbies on your local network
- Lobby Codes
  - You can copy your current lobby's id via the pause menu
  - You can copy a lobby id from the lobby list via the "Code" button
  - You can put the lobby
  - This is my own implementation of the lobby codes inspired by [Better Lobbies](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Ryokune/Better_Lobbies/)
- Lobby Name Filter
  - This is clone of my deprecated mod [LobbyOffensiveNames](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Dev1A3/LobbyOffensiveNames)
